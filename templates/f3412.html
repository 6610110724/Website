            <p>           The 3-4-1-2 formation is a 3-4-3-based formation setup in football that consists of three central defenders, four midfielders, and three forwards.</p>
            <br>
            <center>
            <h2><b>STRENGTHS</b></h2>
            </center>
            <br>
            <h3><b> Defensive Solidity</b></h3>
            <p>           With three CBs and four midfielders, this formation offers a solid defensive base. The three center-backs can cover a lot of ground, while the four midfield players would be able to help for shielding the defense, breaking up opposition attacks and regaining possession.</p>
                
            <h3><b> Midfield Control</b></h3>
            <p>           The four midfielders in this formation provide a solid platform for the team to control the middle of the field. The two central midfielders can help in defense, while the wing-backs can create width in attack.</p>
                
            <h3><b> Flexibility</b></h3>
            <p>           The 3-4-1-2 formation is flexible and can easily switch to a 5-4-1  or 3-3-2-2 formation when defending. This provides extra cover for the defense and makes it difficult for the opposition to break through.</p>
                
            <h3><b> Creativity</b></h3> 
            <p>           The attacking midfielder in this formation can be a creative force for the team. They can play between the lines and create chances for the two forwards. Their ability to pick out passes can unlock the opposition defense and create scoring opportunities.</p>
        
            <br>
            <center>
            <h2><b>WEAKNESSES</b></h2>
            </center>
            <br>
            <h3><b> Overreliance on the Attacking Midfielder</b></h3>
            <p>           The CAM in the 3-4-1-2 formation is a key player in linking the midfield and attack. However, if the opposition can successfully mark the attacking midfielder out of the game, the team may struggle to create chances and score goals.</p>
                
            <h3><b> Lack of Defensive Cover in Midfield</b></h3>
            <p>           While the two central midfielders can provide defensive cover, they can be overrun in midfield by opposition teams that play with three central midfielders. This can make it difficult for the team to control the midfield and create chances in attack.</p>
                
            <h3><b> Vulnerability on the Flanks</b></h3> 
            <p>           With only three centra-backs, the 3-4-1-2 formation can be vulnerable to attacks down the flanks. If the opposition can get in behind the wide midfielders, they can create dangerous attacks against the defense.</p>
